        <li>Milestone 1 - Android 1.0</li>
        <p>In 2005, Google purchased Android, Inc. With this purchase, many believed Google would soon develop phones for customers. However, while Google did enter into the phone industry, they did not make their products available for citizens. Instead, Google provided Android to manufacturers such as, HTC. With the platform Android, HTC created the HTC Dream, which was used to develop Android 1.0, the first Android phone. In many other parts of the world, the Android 1.0 was known as the T-Mobile G1. This phone contained a physical keyboard, a touch screen, 256 MB of internal storage, 192 MB of RAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a rear-facing 3.15-megapixel camera. It also had a Quad-band GSM 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz GPRS/Edge. This phone was released to consumers worldwide on September 23rd, 2008. After its release, consumers shared that their love for Android 1.0 revolved around their ability to use home screen widgets. At the time, iOS did not have this widget, which greatly upset many consumers. This widget wasn’t developed in iOS, until the year 2020. While Android continued to make profits off of their new invention, Apple decided to launch the App Store. Because of this, Android then invented the Google Play Store, which was known as the Market, during this time. If Apple and Android had not thought of creating a place where one could obtain their apps, we probably wouldn’t have all the apps on our phones that we have today! The Android 1.0 also helped develop many other products and services like, Google Maps, Youtube, and an HTML browser, which later became known as Google Chrome.</p>
