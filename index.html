        <h3><li>Milestone 1 - The Founding of Android</li></h3>
        <p>Nearly 18 years ago, in October of the year 2003, Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California. The founders of Android include Rich Miner, Nick Sears, Chris White, and Andy Rubin. The company was founded several years before smartphones were even thought about or, better yet, heard of. The company was also founded before Apple created the very first iPhone and the iOS system. Shortly after the company’s establishment, Andy Rubin stated that in the future years, Android was going to develop “smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner’s location preferences.” Rubin also described Android, Inc. as having “tremendous potential”.  Then, in Tokyo, Japan of the year 2013, Andy Rubin expressed that in Android’s original plans, the company was meant to develop improvements in operating systems of digital cameras. However, at that time, digital cameras were not selling in the consumer market and were drastically declining in sales. The four founders realized that creating improvements for digital cameras would not be a smart move for their newly founded company and could cause their company to shut down in later years. Shortly after this, in September of the year 2004, the Android company decided to switch their original plans of improving digital cameras and instead, develop an OS system that could be used in mobile phones for all. This mobile device would be rivals against Symbian, a platform designed for Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and Nokia, and Microsoft Windows Mobile. This began the giant evolution of the Android, Inc in the phone industry.</p>
        <h3><li>Milestone 2 - Android 1.0 </li></h3>
        <p>In 2005, Google purchased Android, Inc. With this purchase, many believed Google would soon develop phones for customers. However, while Google did enter into the phone industry, they did not make their products available for citizens. Instead, Google provided Android to manufacturers such as, HTC. With the platform Android, HTC created the HTC Dream, which was used to develop Android 1.0, the first Android phone. In many other parts of the world, the Android 1.0 was known as the T-Mobile G1. This phone contained a physical keyboard, a touch screen, 256 MB of internal storage, 192 MB of RAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a rear-facing 3.15-megapixel camera. It also had a Quad-band GSM 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz GPRS/Edge. This phone was released to consumers worldwide on September 23rd, 2008. After its release, consumers shared that their love for Android 1.0 revolved around their ability to use home screen widgets. At the time, iOS did not have this widget, which greatly upset many consumers. This widget wasn’t developed in iOS, until the year 2020. While Android continued to make profits off of their new invention, Apple decided to launch the App Store. Because of this, Android then invented the Google Play Store, which was known as the Market, during this time. If Apple and Android had not thought of creating a place where one could obtain their apps, we probably wouldn’t have all the apps on our phones that we have today! The Android 1.0 also helped develop many other products and services like, Google Maps, Youtube, and an HTML browser, which later became known as Google Chrome.</p>
