        <p>Nearly 18 years ago, in October of the year 2003, <i>Android Inc.</i> was founded in Palo Alto, California. The founders of Android include Rich Miner, Nick Sears, Chris White, and Andy Rubin. The company was founded several years before smartphones were even thought about or, better yet, heard of. The company was also founded before Apple created the very first iPhone and the iOS system. Shortly after the company’s establishment, Andy Rubin stated that in the future years, Android was going to develop “smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner’s location preferences.” Rubin also described Android, Inc. as having “tremendous potential”.  Then, in Tokyo, Japan of the year 2013, Andy Rubin expressed that in Android’s original plans, the company was meant to develop improvements in operating systems of digital cameras. However, at that time, digital cameras were not selling in the consumer market and were drastically declining in sales. The four founders realized that creating improvements for digital cameras would not be a smart move for their newly founded company and could cause their company to shut down in later years. Shortly after this, in September of the year 2004, the Android company decided to switch their original plans of improving digital cameras and instead, develop an OS system that could be used in mobile phones for all. This mobile device would be rivals against Symbian, a platform designed for Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and Nokia, and Microsoft Windows Mobile. This began the giant evolution of the <i>Android, Inc.,</i> in the phone industry.</p></div>

        <div class="Number-2"><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/amp/biggest-android-milestones-1066435/"><h3><li>Milestone 2 - Android 1.0</li></h3></a>
        <p>In 2005, Google purchased Android, Inc. With this purchase, many believed Google would soon develop phones for customers. However, while Google did enter into the phone industry, they did not make their products available for citizens. Instead, Google provided Android to manufacturers such as, HTC. With the platform Android, HTC created the HTC Dream, which was used to develop <i>Android 1.0</i>, the first Android phone. In many other parts of the world, the <i>Android 1.0</i> was known as the T-Mobile G1. This phone contained a physical keyboard, a touch screen, 256 MB of internal storage, 192 MB of RAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a rear-facing 3.15-megapixel camera. It also had a Quad-band GSM 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz GPRS/Edge. This phone was released to consumers worldwide on September 23rd, 2008. After its release, consumers shared that their love for <i>Android 1.0</i> revolved around their ability to use home screen widgets. At the time, iOS did not have this widget, which greatly upset many consumers. This widget wasn’t developed in iOS, until the year 2020. While Android continued to make profits off of their new invention, Apple decided to launch the App Store. Because of this, Android then invented the Google Play Store, which was known as the Market, during this time. If Apple and Android had not thought of creating a place where one could obtain their apps, we probably wouldn’t have all the apps on our phones that we have today! The <i>Android 1.0</i> also helped develop many other products and services like, Google Maps, Youtube, and an HTML browser, which later became known as Google Chrome.</p></div>

        <div class="Number-3"><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/android-version-history/%3famp"><h3><li>Milestone 3 - Updates to the Systems</li></h3></a>
        <p>In 2009, Android released 3 updates, within months of each other, to all Android mobile devices, around the world. The first Android update went by the name, <i>Android 1.5 Cupcake</i>. This update was the first update by Android that used Google’s dessert themed naming system. In this update, Android users were able to use on-screen keyboards, rather than their physical keyboards. The update also included a way for consumers to finally capture videos on their hand-held devices. Shortly after <i>Cupcake</i> was released, Android Inc. then released <i>Android 1.6 Donut</i>. This update allowed users to have access to the quick search box. With this game-changing feature, users could instantly search up anything they needed. From searching the web to accessing local files within a matter of seconds, users were over-joyed by this new system. A few months later, Android released <i>Android 2.0 Éclair</i>. Although users were already amazed by the astounding new updates, Android, Inc. new their system still needed improvements. In this update, Android brought a new feature called the Google Maps navigation. With this feature, individuals were able to use a GPS system in their cars. Internet browsers also received an update by Android. Android users had the ability to watch and play videos on browsers, which brought jealousy to their fierce opponent, the iPhone. Finally, <i>Éclair</i> also changed Android users’ lock screens. Users were allowed to swipe left to unlock their screens, which was similar to the iPhone. Users could also change their phones to mute mode, in their lock screens.</p></div>

        <p>Then, in December of 2010, Google launched the <i>Android 2.3 Gingerbread</i> update, worldwide. This was Android’s seventh update to their system, within a 2-year time period. While this update improved many of the old gadgets from older Android features, it also added new features to all cellular devices. This update came with an improved keyboard and an improved stock widgets and home screen. The embedded keyboards contained new colors for the keys, multitouch support, an improved copy and paste gadget, quicker text input, and it allowed users to have access to a second keyboard, when pressing a multiple amount of keys. <i>Gingerbread</i> also added a new feature to the built-in cameras, selfie mode. In this mode, users were able to switch their cameras to front-facing mode and capture photos or videos, in this way. This feature became known as one of the biggest milestones in history, across the globe. As time passed, <i>Android 2.3 Gingerbread</i> became one of the most widely used version produced by Android in history. Along with the platform, individuals working at Google Play Services began to create a new and improved Android software that could be used on all devices. During this time, Google also launched the Samsung Nexus S. However, the <i>Android 2.3 Gingerbread</i> became entirely more successful than the Samsung Nexus S. The platform sold more than 401,000 units, shortly after its release, and caused a drastic decrease in consumer purchases of the Samsung Nexus S. With this incredibly remarkable update, Android users around the world couldn’t wait for what else Android, Inc. had in store for their consumers.</p></div>

        <div class="Number-5"><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.androidauthority.com/amp/history-android-os-name-789433/"><h3><li>Milestone 5 - Android on Watches</li></h3></a>
        <p>After many remarkable updates, Android, Inc., and Google representatives questioned what their company would do next to attract more consumers. That’s when the astounding idea hit them, why not enter the smartwatch market? With the sudden rise of consumers’ purchases of smartwatches, this idea seemed to be the best for the company and their fans. With this new idea, Android announced their new creation would be targeted at all smartwatch wearers around the globe. In March of 2014, Android created <i>Android Wear</i>, which later became known as <i>Wear OS</i>. This Android invention became the first version of Android that could be worn on individual’s wrists. Features of the watch included, Google Maps, Google Now, and fitness features, which included speed, time, and distance trackers for those looking to exercise in running, cycling, or walking. Fitness was one of the main targets Google and Android, Inc., strived to achieve. Soon after, Samsung and LG also released smartwatches to combat the competition. Android’s smartwatch invention was not only Google’s first smartwatch, but also was the only product that prevented the Apple Watch from being the only watch in the world. Still, <i>Wear OS</i> remains an important platform for all manufacturers that want to create smartwatches. Today, <i>Wear OS</i> can be seen on a numerous amount of fashion brands such as, Diesel, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Tag Heur, and Tommy Hilfiger. This invention marked the beginning of Android’s expansion toward other smart devices. It also marked Google and Android’s partnership in maintaining one of the world’s most popular OS systems.</p></div>
